# ChemLab

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Next Js: For frontend and backend
- GraphQL: For the API
- AssebmlyAI: For speech to text
- Three.js: For the 3D model rendering
- Tailwind: For the styling

## 📅 Best Use of React + GraphQL (Sponsored by Invoca)

We are using GraphQL to simplify the API calls and to make it easier to use the data. It was the first time we were using the GraphQL and we love it. It is a declarative language that allows you to describe a query in a concise and readable way.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com (Sponsored by MLH)

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude. tech. We will choose the best domain name among all.

## 🤖 Best Use of AssemblyAI API (Sponsored by AssemblyAI)

- We are using AssemblyAI API to convert speech to text for search page. User can search about anything by just speaking the word and we will show the result.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- For the first time we were using AssemblyAI API to convert speech to text so were having some trouble with using that.
- We were using GraphQL for the first time, so we had triuble using it, but soon we were able to use it easily.
- Rendering the 3D model was a bit challenging, but we were able to get it done.
- Deploying the app was a bit challenging, but we were able to get it done.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project with a team of 2 people in the given time.
- Implementing all the features of the project.
- Using GraphQL and AssemblyAI API to convert speech to text.

## 📖 What we learned

- We learned how to use the AssemblyAI API and how to use the GraphQL.
- We learned how to use Three.js.
- We learned valuable collaboration skills.

## 🚀 What's next for ChemLab

- Adding more features to the app.
- Adding more 3D models.
- Adding Virtual Reality support.
